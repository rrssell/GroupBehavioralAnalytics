Behavioral analytics involves collecting data on various user actions, such as clicks, page views, and time spent on a page or within 
an application, so we can say that one of the disadvantages of this technology is the potential breach of privacy to collect data. 
This data can then be analyzed using various tools and techniques to identify trends and patterns in 
user behavior. For example, a company may use behavioral analytics to identify which features of their product are most popular or to 
track the user journey through their website.
Behavioral analytics can be used as a tool in cybersecurity to help organizations detect and respond to potential security 
threats on the internet. By monitoring user behavior and identifying abnormal activity, security teams can quickly detect and respond 
to potential breaches and protect their networks and data from harm.

Behavioral analytics in cybersecurity involves collecting data on user activity within a network or system, such as login attempts,
 how users interact with websites and online services, file access, and network traffic. This data can then be analyzed using machine
 learning and other techniques to identify patterns of behavior that may indicate a security threat.
