The Internet has become imbedded in the lives of people around the world, whether young or old, and is 
continuously being utilized to connect people with each other, to serve as a tool for broadcasting and 
news, to get peopleâ€™s jobs done in some fields, to bring entertainment and joy to the masses, to be an 
equipment for education, and much more. Essentially, the internet, along with social media, became a necessity 
and a must for a lot of people globally, whether professionally or personally. Even though we know that the 
Internet is a great aid for us, it can also lead us to harm because it is not a place where security and the 
well-being of the people are absolute. That's why netizens, the people, need to know and be armed with enough 
knowledge to make their browsing safe and comfortable for them.

As people become more reliant on and their usage of the internet increases, especially during times of pandemic, 
to help them in different aspects of their lives, people with malicious intent also see the internet as bringing 
harm to them. Our group decided to discuss cybersecurity on the Internet like Facebook and Twitter for different 
reasons: primarily, the Internet is relevant and will stay relevant to the daily lives of people around the world, 
like communication; secondly, the Internet can be a great tool for professional and educational purposes; and lastly, 
the Internet can bring positivity and entertainment to people. Our group researched and found a very efficient, effective, 
yet scary technology that can be a powerful tool for cybersecurity: the behavioral analytics.
