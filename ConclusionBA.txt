In summary, the Internet is not a safe place and is infested with people who have malicious thoughts and actions. 
That’s why cybersecurity is important to keep the environment of netizens safe and comfortable. Behavioral analytics is one of the 
best tools for cybersecurity. As people's engagement and interaction with the internet increase, so does the capability of this analytic
technology as more data comes in, helping it grow and become a more reliable security tool while browsing the internet. It helps the 
system keep track of people’s activities online so it can properly respond if something out of the ordinary happens. Having behavioral 
analytics is one of the keys to having a secure and successful system and organization, as it continuously improves to erase the 
vulnerability of the platform and keep everyone safe.

In conclusion, even though there is a potential risk of privacy breaches using behavioral analytics, we believe that responsible, 
ethical, and proper usage of this technology will help the advancement of cybersecurity and combat illegal activities online. 
With the amount of people using the internet to do things, a team or a group of people will not be enough to moderate millions, 
if not billions, of users manually. That’s why behavioral analytics can provide them with a more comprehensive and proactive 
approach to cybersecurity, enabling them to detect and respond to threats more quickly and effectively.
