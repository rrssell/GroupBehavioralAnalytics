Behavioral analytics is one of the most prominent emerging technologies in the field starting in 2019. It is a method of collecting and analyzing data with algorithms and machine learning on how users interact with a product or service. This data can then be used to gain insights into user behavior patterns and improve the overall user experience. Our group decided to support the utilization of said technology, even though there is always risk. If we can use it ethically and responsibly, then we think that it is a powerful tool to combat threats and promote cybersecurity.
