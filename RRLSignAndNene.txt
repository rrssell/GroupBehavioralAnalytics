According to Sign and Nene (2013) "It is important to design big data-driven cybersecurity solutions that effectively and efficiently derive actionable intelligence from available heterogeneous sources of information using principled data analytics methods.". They also explained that data analytics technologies need to use various machine learning algorithms and human-driven knowledge for organizing and handling the data. In essence, they conducted a survey on machine learning for internet threats. Pattern matching, machine learning, and hardware computation are some of the best ways and tools to provide cybersecurity against attacks and malicious intents. We concluded that technologies like behavioral analytics will serve as a powerful tool to combat cybercrimes and that we need to further strengthen them.
